# poivizdynamic

Animate your point-of-interest map! Make the point-trace/ value-trend moving! 

This package helps users more easily visualize dynamic points/ value change on the map, observing {value amount/ point position} changes dynamically as the time-bar moves forward. 

Users firstly need to prepare the POI dataset following the fake_demo_data format which can be found in the poivizdynamic/data folder. Then they can customize their easy animated maps with functions provided here.
